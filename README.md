# ProjectManagementSystem
In this project I have developed a software system where a client can set up, edit and delete projects. Java was used for creating a desktop application with graphical user interface. Furthermore, I have integrated Kotlin into the Java GUI. It plays it's role by the domain and entity classes I have created to represent the tasks in a project as a graph. Additionally I have set up adjacency matrix which allows to represent my graph.
